The reason that the .next section has a height is because without it, the new item will show below and force the buttons down, just until the old item is hidden.

The API was very simple to use, especially since they provided this: http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions. This is a list of all weather conditions they provide. They also provide an icon set. I was planning on building my own if/else or try block to see my own icons. This proved very useful. 

As well, going to the API page itself and seeing what data was output was helpful in debugging why I wasn't getting data i needed. This can be seen at: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?mode=json&units=imperial&lat=42.770407299999995&lon=-73.7163961&APPID=a5056bd629bba3900301369ba991246a
